# Kernel-lectures

These are my Linux kernel lectures for the GlobalLogic kernel course (Spring 2020).
* Lecture 3. Hardware overview. Working with sources, cross-compilation. First kernel module.
* Lecture 4. Basic data structures.
* Lecture 5. Introduction to kernel debugging.
* Lecture 6. Timers, Delays, Deferred Works.
* Lecture 7. Kthreads Overview. Interrupt Handling.
* Lectures 11, 12, 13. Concurrency and race conditions.
* Lecture 23. Network device drivers.

You can find Sam Protsenko's lectures in his [repository](https://github.com/joe-skb7/kernel-lectures)

There are records of the lectures on a YouTube [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVW3-sceyFeW9d5WkujpUdRH97icrlLCf) (lectures of mine are in Ukrainian, others are in Russian).

## TODO
* It would be very nice to fix and update all these slides as well as to convert them into LaTeX and make them in common style. But I will have time for this only when/if I will teach the course once more.
