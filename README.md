# kernel-lectures

These are my Linux kernel lectures for GlobalLogic kernel course.

You can find Sam Protsenko's lectures in his [repository](https://github.com/joe-skb7/kernel-lectures)

There are records of the lectures on YouTube [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVW3-sceyFeW9d5WkujpUdRH97icrlLCf) (lectures of mine are in Ukrainian, other are in Russian).
